# Misericorde Song Sorter
A fun way to manually merge sort a looot of music to make a song ranking. This was adapted from kasha's Touhou Song Sorter.
For now I haven't managed to upload it as a website, so in order to run it you will need to open the file named index.html. 
Please ignore the Volume 2 checkbox (or uncheck it), since it hasn't come out yet (we will be waiting). 
Have fun!
